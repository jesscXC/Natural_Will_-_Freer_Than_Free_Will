## Accept Natural Will to Get Freedom from Self-Punishment
<br>

What is natural will? It is the understanding that choices are made due to the entirety of nature's influences. It is the better counterpart to free will.

Does acceptance of natural will take away your kindness to others? Does it take away your compassion, your desire to grow, your desire to love and create?

I believe it does not.

Accept natural will. With natural will, you are able to experience life more deliberately and directly, rather than being stuck inside your head. Instead of analyzing the past and fretting over the future, you realize you _are_ nature, and so you can be more present in the Now.

Realize that you are a process of nature observing itself. It is nature choosing, not a limited physical body. This allows you to make peace with the past and accept what the future brings.

Watch your body act and your mind run, instead of living inside your head. You can let go of who you think you are supposed to be. Instead realize you are nature interacting with itself.

Free will causes suffering because you imagine you can fail at nature, at your potential in life.

You can make no wrong decision in life. Neither can a leaf falling from a tree.

Watch your experiences with amusement. See how your life is a natural process of the universe, ever flowing.

There is no barrier between you and the world. A change in gravity from a star exploding 10,000 light-years away can ripple out and change your experiences. You are nature, not separate from it.

You are an amazing pattern of nature.

When you accept that your choices are nature's, you can give up self-punishment.

There is mental suffering when we believe we've chosen incorrectly. When you realize you are nature, you can let yourself be in nature. We are experiences in nature, and we cannot defy nature.

To have inner peace, dispense with the idea that you are separate from nature.

Accept that your mind is a natural process and you allow yourself freedom from self-punishment.

## Unpredictable Free Will

"Because of the chaotic quantum unpredictability of nature, our will is free from prediction."

Consider it: The universe evolves in an unpredictable manner. We create models in science to predict, but these are always approximate. With quantum mechanics we realize events are based on probabilities rather than certainties. Particles have probabilities of where they will be found. It cannot be known where a particle is until we measure it, which affects where it is going.

If our will cannot be predicted in principle, then we are free from predicting the choices of others.

Our desires are of course determined by the history of our species. The behavior of our ancestors create the world we live in now.

To some extent we have "free want". We feel a freedom in choosing what we want, what has led our species to be successful in the past.

## A Soul's Death

If your mind is uploaded to a computer and your body dies, do you still exist?

## Accept Control is an Illusion

O great Mystery, wise mind that permeates this universe, please grant me humbleness before you so that I may climb a little higher on the vine I am clutching.

I sit here now and ponder if there are any fundamental differences between human nature and the creations of the natural world.

Are the telephone poles around us, which seem to break up the fractal pattern of nature, somehow apart from it?

Are we all just living in a system we have grown used to, like the bird that perches on a wire as if it is a branch?

By this I mean, do we take our blessings for granted, running on the hedonic treadmill instead of sitting and noticing the beauty of the space around us? When is enough enough?

Then again, can we really do anything nature doesn't want us to do, if we really are magnificent emergent information patterns?

Why live in imagined worlds of suffering, so focused on the future or the past? Why not live in the present?

Is it possible with automatic imagination to markedly reduce pain's influence over our lives? Evolutionary pressures may have made our system of pain be roundabout and complex, but most complex systems have vulnerabilities we can exploit.

The real issue is this:

If we are mental patterns, forces of nature, why not realize these human bodies are tools to wear?

Why not accept that free will is a trick? Why not notice our senses are moving along sense-objects?

Does this not actually give us _more_ freedom from suffering and worry?

If we realize our minds are nature's, does this not give us more ability to be comfortable in experiencing the Now?

## The Fictitious Story of Identity
<br>
ty13.6.2s

Your mind is an interpreter of stories -- information patterns. The mind thinks in stories.

The sense of self, of identity, is a fictional story. It sometimes helps you cooperate with others.

When you are tricked into believing that your identity exists in reality, you allow suffering. Inner peace is challenged when you believe you must be a certain way.

The truth is that nature _is_ a certain way. As a force of nature, you should accept what is happening.

You are the doing, not the doer nor the done. Your body is a wonderful mechanism that nature has put together.

The information patterns of your mind are inscribed by nature, there's no need to try to control them.

When you recognize you _are_ nature, your awareness can watch your body behave according to the scripts it follows. Yet you aren't tied up in them, you are free to watch.
